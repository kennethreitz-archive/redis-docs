Redis Replication Howto
=======================

General Information
-------------------

Redis replication is a very simple to use and configure
master-slave replication that allows slave Redis servers to be
exact copies of master servers. The following are some very
important facts about Redis replication:

-  A master can have multiple slaves.
-  Slaves are able to accept other slaves connections, so instead
   to connect a number of slaves against the same master it is also
   possible to connect some of the slaves to other slaves in a
   graph-alike structure.
-  Redis replication is non-blocking on the master side, this means
   that the master will continue to serve queries while one or more
   slaves are performing the first synchronization. Instead
   replication is blocking on the slave side: while the slave is
   performing the first synchronization it can't reply to queries.
-  Replications can be used both for scalability, in order to have
   multiple slaves for read-only queries (for example heavy
   `SORT <SortCommand.html>`_ operations can be launched against
   slaves), or simply for data redundancy.
-  It is possible to use replication to avoid the saving process on
   the master side: just configure your master redis.conf in order to
   avoid saving at all (just comment al the "save" directives), then
   connect a slave configured to save from time to time.

How Redis replication works
---------------------------

In order to start the replication, or after the connection closes
in order resynchronize with the master, the slave connects to the
master and issues the SYNC command.
The master starts a background saving, and at the same time starts
to collect all the new commands received that had the effect to
modify the dataset. When the background saving completed the master
starts the transfer of the database file to the slave, that saves
it on disk, and then load it in memory. At this point the master
starts to send all the accumulated commands, and all the new
commands received from clients that had the effect of a dataset
modification, to the slave, as a stream of commands, in the same
format of the Redis protocol itself.
You can try it yourself via telnet. Connect to the Redis port while
the server is doing some work and issue the SYNC command. You'll
see a bulk transfer and then every command received by the master
will be re-issued in the telnet session.
Slaves are able to automatically reconnect when the master ``<->``
slave link goes down for some reason. If the master receives
multiple concurrent slave synchronization requests it performs a
single background saving in order to serve all them.
Configuration
-------------

To configure replication is trivial: just add the following line to
the slave configuration file:
::

    slaveof 192.168.1.1 6379

Of course you need to replace 192.168.1.1 6379 with your master ip
address (or hostname) and port.
