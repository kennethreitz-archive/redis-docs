Configuration
=============

The ``redis.conf`` file included in the source code distribution is
a starting point, you should be able to modify it in order do adapt
it to your needs without troubles reading the comments inside the
file.
In order to start Redis using a configuration file just pass the
file name as the sole argument when starting the server:
::

    $ ./redis-server redis.conf
