    edis_version:0.07
    connected_clients:1
    connected_slaves:0
    used_memory:3187
    changes_since_last_save:0
    last_save_time:1237655729
    total_connections_received:1
    total_commands_processed:1
    uptime_in_seconds:25
    uptime_in_days:0

All the fields are in the form ``field:value``
Notes
-----


-  ``used_memory`` is returned in bytes, and is the total number of
   bytes allocated by the program using ``malloc``.
-  ``uptime_in_days`` is redundant since the uptime in seconds
   contains already the full uptime information, this field is only
   mainly present for humans.
-  ``changes_since_last_save`` does not refer to the number of key
   changes, but to the number of operations that produced some kind of
   change in the dataset.
